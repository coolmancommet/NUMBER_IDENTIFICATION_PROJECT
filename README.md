Keras is an open-source neural-network library written in Python. It is capable of running on top of TensorFlow, Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit, R, Theano, or PlaidML. Designed to enable fast experimentation with deep neural networks, it focuses on being user-friendly, modular, and extensible. It was developed as part of the research effort of project ONEIROS (Open-ended Neuro-Electronic Intelligent Robot Operating System), and its primary author and maintainer is François Chollet, a Google engineer. Chollet also is the author of the XCeption deep neural network model. 

Keras contains numerous implementations of commonly used neural-network building blocks such as layers, objectives, activation functions, optimizers, and a host of tools to make working with image and text data easier to simplify the coding necessary for writing deep neural network code. The code is hosted on GitHub, and community support forums include the GitHub issues page, and a Slack channel. 

OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision.

OpenCV's application areas include:

    2D and 3D feature toolkits
    Egomotion estimation
    Facial recognition system
    Gesture recognition
    Human–computer interaction (HCI)
    Mobile robotics
    Motion understanding
    Object identification
    Segmentation and recognition
    Stereopsis stereo vision: depth perception from 2 cameras
    Structure from motion (SFM)
    Motion tracking
    Augmented reality
